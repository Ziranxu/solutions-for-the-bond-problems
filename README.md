A rate tree based on dynamics dlnr = µ(lnr,t)dt + σdz and showed that, for example, ru = rd* exp(2σ*sqrt(∆t)).
(a) Calibrate a tree to the two year treasury bond, assuming σ = 0.08.Verify that your tree prices the two year treasury bond with 
current market prices.
(b) Calibrate a tree to the two year treasury bond, matching both forwards in expectation as well as prices. What is σ 1 ?
(c) Extend this tree to the three year treasury bond, matching its forwards and price. Verify that the tree prices each calibrated 
instrument according to the market. What is σ 2 ?
(d) The following problems fix the tree calibrated in the preceding question.
    i. Price a three year bond paying par in three years with an annual 5.25 coupon.
       If the market price is $101.10, what is the bond’s OAS?
    ii. Price a three year callable bond, callable in years one and two for $ 99.50, with annual 5.25 coupons.
       If the market price of this callable bond is $99.75, what is its OAS? What is the effective duration? The effective convexity?
       What is the Yield to Call for this bond?
    iii. Price a three year putable bond, putable in years one and two for $ 99.50, with annual 5.25 coupons and the same OAS as callable
        bond trading at $99.75.
